## Discussion
New Product Domain: Advising API and site for CEA students
Possible requirements:
They should be able to more easily see information from the perspective of student and professor
A professor/advisor should be able to check how many students they have who could possibly graduate
Students should be able to say they want to register for classes and receive a copy of their checklist, and a meeting with their advisor
